Hello , 
This is my simulation of the scalar pipelined processor.
The code for the simulation is in main.cpp.
My teammate is Aditya Jain cs22b065.
I am Raadhes Chandaluru CS22B069.

We have both discussed implementation techniques but implemented code separately.
The simulation in the main.cpp file here was purely written by me with some help from my teammate.

To test the code :
Navigate to CS22B069_LAB8 folder

To compile :
g++ main.cpp -o main.exe

Input files :
Keep the DCache.txt, ICache.txt and RF.txt files in the Input folder under CS22B069_LAB8 folder.

Output directory : IMPORTANT
Make sure to create folder named "Output" under the CS22B069_LAB8 folder.

To run :
./main.exe

To check output : 
The files Output.txt and DCache.txt should appear in the Output folder previously created.
